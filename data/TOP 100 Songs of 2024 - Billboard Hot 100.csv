Lyrics:
We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can’t be sold 
We were right til we weren’t
Built a home and watched it burn 
 
I didn’t wanna leave you 
I didn’t wanna lie
Started to cry but then remembered I
 
I can buy myself flowers 
Write my name in the sand 
Talk to myself for hours 
Say things you don’t understand 
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah I can love me better than you can
 
I can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
 
Paint my nails, cherry red 
Match the roses that you left 
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said 
 
I didn’t wanna wanna leave you 
I didn’t wanna fight 
Started to cry but then remembered I 
 
I can buy myself flowers 
Write my name in the sand 
Talk to myself for hours 
Say things you don’t understand 
I can take myself dancing 
And I can hold my own hand 
Yeah I can love me better than you can 
 
I can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I
 
I didn’t wanna wanna leave you 
I didn’t wanna fight 
Started to cry but then remembered I 
 
I can buy myself flowers 
Write my name in the sand 
Talk to myself for hours 
Say things you don’t understand 
I can take myself dancing 
And I can hold my own hand 
Yeah I can love me better than
Yeah I can love me better than you can
 
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better

Ey
Mami, te siento lejo, dime dónde estás
Te quiero chingar, te voy a raptar
Déjate llevar, apaga el celular
Que si estás conmigo, no te va a pasar na

Solo déjate llevar
Tate atenta a la fuga
(Si yo quiero contigo y tú quiere' conmigo)
(Dime si se da, rrr)

Ba-ba-baby, dale, ponte pa' mí, follow me
Tú ere', like, for me y yo 'toy pa' ti
Gata, tú está' only, mándame tu ubi
Mueve los cachete' al ritmo del TikTok

Conmigo esa gata se escapó
Y, еn su casa, nadie lo notó
Que conmigo la baby esta nochе la pasó cabrón
Gata, pon el celu en modo avión
Tú mi loca y yo, tu locotrón
Tú te pone' pa' mí y yo por ti me tiro to'a la misión

Mami, te siento lejo', dime dónde estás
Te quiero chingar, te voy a raptar
Déjate llevar y apaga el celular
Que si estás conmigo, no te va a pasar na'

Solo déjate llevar
'Tate atenta a la fuga
Si yo quiero contigo y tú quiere' conmigo
(Dime si se da)

Ba-ba-baby, dale, ponte pa' mí, follow me
Tú ere', like, for me, yo tu Brad Pitt
Gata, tú está' only, mándame tu ubi
Mueve los cachete' al ritmo del TikTok

Conmigo esa gata se escapó
El que la rompe soy yo
Me la robó de menor

Otra noche dándote, dándote
Tocándote, calentándote
Así, bailándote
Al oído, gimiéndome

Y yo la sigo enamorando, regalando
Te estoy comprando
Lo que uste', mamita, quiere
Ahora nos 'tamo alejando, no te estoy viendo, los día' volando
Estar sola, tú prefiere'

Ven y dame un chance pa' guayarte
Allá vamo' a mojarte toa' las parte'
To'a la noche dándote, dándote
Tocándote, calentándote

Baby, dale, ponte pa' mí, follow me
Tú ere', like, for me, yo tu Brad Pitt
Gata, tú está' only, mándame tu ubi
Mueve los cachete' al ritmo del TikTok

Conmigo esa gata se escapó
El que la rompe soy yo
Me la robó de menor

Lyrics:
For a while there it was rough 
But lately I’ve been doing better 
Than the last four cold Decembers
I recall 
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She’ll come and stay the night
I think I might have it all 
And I thank god everyday 
For the girl he sent my way 
But I know the things he gives me
He can take away 
And I hold you every night
That’s a feeling I wanna get used to 
But there’s no man as terrified 
As the man who stands to lose you 
Oh I hope I don’t lose you
Mmm
Please 
Stay
I want you I need you oh God
Don’t 
Take
These beautiful things that I’ve got
Please stay 
I want you I need you oh God
Don’t take
These beautiful things that I’ve got
Please don’t take,
I found my mind I’m feeling sane
It’s been a while but I’m finding my faith
If everything’s good and it’s great why do I sit and wait till it’s gone
Oh I’ll tell ya I know I’ve got enough
I got peace,
And I got love,
But I’m up at night thinking I just might lose it all
Please stay 
I want you I need you oh God
Don’t take
These beautiful things that I’ve got
Please stay
I want you I need you oh god
I need
These beautiful things that I’ve got

► Official “Die For You (Remix)” Lyrics:
I'm findin' ways to articulate the feelin' I'm goin' through
I just can't say I don't love you
'Cause I love you, yeah
It's hard for me to communicate the thoughts that I hold
But tonight, I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah

You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
You're scared to be lonely, 'specially in the night
I'm scared that I'll miss you, happens every time
I don't want this feelin', I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain't workin', 'cause you're perfect, and I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh

Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind
'Cause baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah

I’m finding ways to stay concentrated
On what I gotta do
But baby boy it’s so hard round you
And yes I’m blaming you
And you know I can’t fake it now or never
And you insinuating that you think we might be better 
Better me & you 
Yeah I know you do

You know what I'm thinkin', see it in your eyes
You hate that you want me, hate it when you cry
It ain't workin', 'cause you're perfect
And I know you deserve it

I can't walk away, oh
Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind
'Cause baby, I would die for you, uh
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
I would die for you, I would lie for you

Keep it real with you, I would kill for you
My baby
I'm just sayin', yeah
I would die for you, I would lie for you
Keep it real with you, I would kill for you
My baby
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, ooh
Even though we're goin' through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind
'Cause baby, I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah (oh, babe)

LYRICS:
Now he’s thinkin’ bout me
Every night, oh
Is it that sweet?
I guess so
Say you can’t sleep
Baby I know
That’s that me
Espresso
Move it up down
Left right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can’t sleep
Baby I know
That’s that me
Espresso
 
I can’t relate
To desperation
My ‘give a fucks’ are on vacation
And I got this one boy
And he won’t stop calling
When they act this way
I know I got em’
 
Too bad your ex don’t do it for ya
Walked in and dream came trued it for ya
Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya
I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
That morning coffee brewed it for ya
One touch and I brand newed it for ya
 
Now he’s thinkin’ bout me
Every night, oh
Is it that sweet?
I guess so
Say you can’t sleep
Baby I know
That’s that me
Espresso
Move it up down
Left right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can’t sleep
Baby I know
That’s that me
Espresso
 
(Holy shit)
Is it that sweet? I guess so
 
I’m working late
Cause I’m a singer
Oh he looks so cute
Wrapped around my finger
My twisted humor
Make him laugh so often
My honey bee
Come and get this pollen
 
Too bad your ex don’t do it for ya
Walked in and dream came trued it for ya
Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya
I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
That morning coffee brewed it for ya
One touch and I brand newed it for ya
 
Now he’s thinkin’ bout me
Every night, oh
Is it that sweet?
I guess so
Say you can’t sleep
Baby I know
That’s that me
Espresso
Move it up down
Left right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can’t sleep
Baby I know
That’s that me
Espresso
 
He’s thinkin’ bout me
Every night, oh
Is it that sweet?
I guess so
Say you can’t sleep
Baby I know
That’s that me

Favorite Song

I’m on the stage right now
Singing your favorite song
Look in the crowd and you’re no where to be found as they sing along 
I say,
You look good without no makeup
No lashes even better when you wake up 
uh-uh-uh
I see the look on your face
I see ya hiding the hate
I see ya looking for someone to scoop you right off of your feet
You wanna ride in a Wraith
You wanna go out on dates
You want somebody to come bring you flowers
Someone to talk to for hours
Wash your back while y’all sit in the shower
Someone to tell you “you’re beautiful”
Someone to tell you and mean it
Someone to tell you I love you everyday
And don’t got a reason
You want someone to bring you peace
Someone to help you sleep
Someone to pick you up when you feeling down feeling lonely
Need somebody
Who can make it better
Somebody
Who can open up those gates
Open up those gates to your heart
Only if you’ll let me
I’m on the stage right now
Singing your favorite song
Look in the crowd and you’re no where to be found as they sing along 
I say,
You look good without no makeup
No lashes even better when you wake up 
uh-uh-uh
I see the look on you face
I see ya looking for peace
I see ya tired of the hurt
Tired of the pain 
Tired of the nights where you can’t get no sleep
I see you’re tired thinking bout if he cheat
See you’re tired thinking bout if you leaving
See you’re tired of being so tired
And ya damn sure ain’t getting even
Need somebody
Who can make it better
Somebody
Who can open up those gates
Open up those gates to your heart
Only if you’ll let me
I’m on the stage right now
Singing your favorite song
Look in the crowd and you’re no where to be found as they sing along 
I say,
You look good without no makeup
No lashes even better when you wake up 
uh-uh-uh

Official ‘Cruel Summer’ Lyrics
Written by Taylor Swift, Jack Antonoff & Annie Clark

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night 
You know that I caught it
bad bad boy
Shiny toy, with a price 
You know that I bought it 
killing me slow
Out the window
I’m always waiting for you to be waiting below Devils roll the dice
Angels roll their eyes 
What doesn’t kill me 
Makes me want you more And it’s new
The shape of your body 
It’s blue
The feeling I got and it’s 
Ooh 
It’s a cruel summer 
It’s cool
That’s what I tell ‘em
No rules in breakable heaven but 
Ooh 
It’s a cruel summer 
With you Hang your head low
In the glow of the vending machine
I’m not dying
We say that we’ll just screw 
it up in these trying times
We’re not trying 
So cut the headlights
Summer’s a knife
I’m always waiting for you just to cut to the bone 
Devils roll the dice
Angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed you’ll be the last to know Chorus I’m drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar
Said ‘I’m ﬁne’ but it wasn’t true
I don’t want to keep secrets 
Just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate every night that summer 
Just to seal my fate
And I scream ‘For whatever it’s worth,
I love you, ain’t that the worst thing you ever heard?’ He looks up grinning like a devil Chorus I’m drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar 
Said ‘I’m ﬁne’ but it wasn’t true
I don’t want to keep secrets 
Just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate every night that summer
Just to seal my fate
And I scream ‘For whatever it’s worth,
I love you, ain’t that the worst thing you ever heard?’

►Lyrics:
Written by Taylor Swift and Jack Antonoff

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I’ve ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices, they come with prices and vices, I end up in crisis
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming one day I’ll watch as you’re leaving ‘cause you got tired of my scheming - for the last time

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I’m a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out
Slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism like some kind of congressman 
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming 
one day I’ll watch as you’re leaving and life will lose all its meaning - for the last time 

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers ‘round and reads it
And then someone screams out
“She’s laughing up at us from hell!”

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me

It’s me
Hi

Everybody agrees
Everybody agrees

It’s me
Hi
I’m the problem, it’s me
At teatime
Everybody agrees
I’ll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Official “we can’t be friends (wait for your love)” Lyrics:
i didn’t think you’d understand me how could you ever even try
i don’t want to tiptoe
but i don’t wanna hide
but i don’t want to feed this monstrous fire
just want to let this story die and i’ll be alright
we can’t be friends
but i’d like to just pretend
you cling to your papers and pens wait until you like me again
wait for your love
love
i'll want for your love
me and my truth we sit in silence baby girl it’s just me and you cause i don’t wanna argue
but i don’t wanna bite
my tongue yeah i think i'd rather die
you got me misunderstood but at least i look this good
we can’t be friends
but i’d like to just pretend
you cling to your papers and pens wait until you like me again
wait for your love
love
i'll want for your love
know that you made me
i don’t like how you paint me yet i’m still here hanging
not what you made me something like a daydream but i feel so seen in the night so for now it’s only me
and maybe that’s all i need
we can’t be friends
but i’d like to just pretend
you cling to your papers and pens wait until you like me again
wait for your love
love
i'll want for your love

Lyrics: 
Baby you can
Find me under the lights
Diamonds under my eyes
Turn the rhythm up
Don’t you wanna just
Come along for the ride

Oh my outfit so tight
You can see my heart beat tonight
I can take the heat
Baby best believe
That’s the moment I shine

Cuz every romance
Shakes and it bends
Don’t give a damn

When the nights here
I don’t do tears
Baby no chance

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
My heart could be burning but you won’t see it on my face
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
I’ll still keep the party running not one hair out of place

Lately I’ve been
Moving close to the edge
Still be looking my best
I stay on the beat
You can count on me
I ain’t missing no steps

Cuz every romance
Shakes and it bends
Don’t give a damn

When the nights here
I don’t do tears
Baby no chance

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance 
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
My heart could be burning but you won’t see it on my face 
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
I’ll still keep the party running not one hair out of place

When my heart breaks
You’ll never see it, never see it
When my world shakes
I feel alive, I feel alive
I don’t play safe
Don’t you know about me

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Even when the tears are flowing
They’re diamonds on my face
I’ll still keep the party going not one hair out of place
Even when the tears are flowing
They’re diamonds on my face
I’ll still keep the party going not one hair out of place

Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
My heart could be burning but you won’t see it on my face
Watch me, dance
Dance the night away
I’ll still keep the party running not one hair out of place

When my heart breaks
You’ll never see it, never see it
When my world shakes
I feel alive, I feel alive
I don’t play safe
Don’t you know about me

I could dance, I could dance, I could dance

Dance the night

Lyrics:
I used to float, now I just fall down
I used to know, but I'm not sure now
What I was made for
What was I made for?

Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real
Just somethin' you paid for
What was I made for?

'Cause I, I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might

Mm, mm, ah
Mm, mm, mm

When did it end? All the enjoyment
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend
It's not what he's made for
What was I made for?

'Cause I, 'cause I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Someday, I might

Think I forgot how to be happy
Somethin' I'm not, but somethin' I can be
Somethin' I wait for
Somethin' I'm made for
Somethin' I'm made for

Lyrics: 
He said, are you serious
I’ve tried but i can’t figure out
I’ve been next to you all night and still don’t know what you’re about 
You keep talking
But not much coming out your mouth
Can’t you tell that i want you ?” 
I say, yeah

I would want myself 
Baby please believe me
I’ll put you through hell just to know me (ya ya) 
So sure of yourself 
Baby don’t get greedy 
That shit won’t end well
No it won’t end well 

I see you eyeing me down
But you’ll never know much past my name 
Or how i’m running this room around
And that i’m still half your age
Yeah you’re l-l-looking at me like i’m some sweet escape 
Obvious that you want me but i said

I would want myself
Baby please believe me
I’ll put you through hell just to know me yeah yeah 
So sure of yourself
Baby don’t get greedy
That shit won’t end well
No it won’t end well 

He said, “i’m just curious
Is this for real or just an act
Can’t tell if you love or hate me 
Never met someone like that
Drive me so so so crazy
Did you know you got that effect?”
I said, “lemme check”

Yeah
I would want myself
Baby please believe me 
I’ll put you through hell 
Just to know me yeah yeah 
So sure of yourself

[Verse 1]
My baby want a Birkin
, she's been tellin' me all night long
Gasoline and groceries, the list goes on and on
This 9 to 5 ain't workin', why the hell do I work so hard?
I can't worry 'bout my problems, I can't take 'em when I'm gone (Uh)


[Pre-Chorus]
One, here comes the two, to the three, to the four
Tell 'em ""Bring another round"", we need plenty more
Two steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor
Oh my, good Lord




[Chorus]
Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history
Therе's a party downtown, near 5th Street
Everybody at the bar gеttin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy


[Verse 2]
I've been Boozey since I left, I ain't changin' for a check
Tell my ma', I ain't forget (Oh, Lord, uh)


Woke up drunk at 10 a.m., we gon' do this shit again
Tell your girl to bring a friend (Oh, Lord)


[Pre-Chorus]
One, here comes the two, to the three, to the four
Tell 'em ""Bring another round"", we need plenty more
Two steppin' on the table, she don't need a dance floor
Oh my, good Lord


[Chorus]
Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (A double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history (We go way back)


There's a party downtown, near 5th Street
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (Woo)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (At the bar gettin' tipsy)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy


[Bridge]
One, here comes the two, to the three, to the four
When it's last call and they kick us out the door
It's gettin' kind of late but the ladies want some more
Oh my, good Lord (Tell 'em drinks on me)


[Chorus]
Someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (A double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history (Way back)
There's a party downtown, near 5th Street (Come on)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (Woo-ooh)
Can someone pour me up a double shot of whiskey (A double shot of whiskey)
They know me and Jack Daniel's got a history (It's Jack D)
At the bottom of a bottle gon' miss me (Baby, don't miss me)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy (At the bar gettin' tipsy)
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy
Everybody at the bar gettin' tipsy

[Outro]
That's fuckin' messed up, bro, they kicked me out the bar

Lyrics:
Last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all 
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night

I kiss your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack we split a fifth
Just talk about life goin' sip for sip
You, you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me

I know that last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all 
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night
No way it was our last night

No way it was the last night that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You call your momma, I call your bluff
In the middle of the night, pull it right back up
Yeah my, my friends say let her go
Your friends say what the hell
I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else 

Oh baby, last night we let the liquor talk
I can't remember everything we said but we said it all 
You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But baby, baby somethin's tellin' me this ain't over yet

No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough 
I can’t remember everything we said but we said too much
I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left
But baby, baby somethin’s tellin’ me this ain’t over yet
No way it was our last night
No way it was our last night

I know you said this time you really weren’t coming back again,
But baby, baby somethin’s tellin’ me this ain’t over yet. 
No way it was our last night
No way it was our last night

LYRICS:
I know I have good judgement
I know I have good taste
It’s funny and it’s ironic
That only I feel that way
I promise ‘em that you’re different
And everyone makes mistakes
But just don’t
 
I heard that you’re an actor
So act like a stand up guy
Whatever devils inside you
Don’t let him out tonight
I tell them it’s just your culture
And everyone rolls their eyes
Yeah I know
 
All I’m asking baby
 
Please please please don’t prove I’m right
Please please please
Don’t bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing
My egos another
I beg you don’t embarrass me
Mother fucker ahhh
Please please please
 
Well I have a fun idea babe
Maybe just stay inside
I know you’re craving some fresh air
But the ceiling fan is so nice
And we could live so happily
If no one knows that you’re with me
I’m just kidding
But really
Kinda
Really
Really
 
Please please please don’t prove I’m right
Please please please
Don’t bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing
My egos another
I beg you don’t embarrass me
Mother fucker ahhh
Please please please
 
If you wanna go and be stupid
Don’t do it in front of me
If you don’t wanna cry to my music
Don’t make me hate you prolifically
Please please please
Please please please
Please
Please
Please

Esa falda,
Chiquitita,
Que bonita te queda,
La veía to’ los días,
Ahora es cuando se pueda,
Y de la uni yo la saco hasta donde se hospeda,
Y las demás que sigan envidiando,
Por eso no prosperan

Esa falda,
Chiquitita,
Ay que bonita te queda,
Yo la veía to’ los días,
Ahora es cuando se pueda,
Y de la uni yo la saco hasta donde se hospeda,
Y las demás que sigan envidiando,
Por eso no prosperan

Ese culo,
Pone a las demás inseguras,
Ella a mi me des configura,
Mezcla lo sensual,
La calle y la finura,
Cuando quiere no disimula,
Hoy va pa’ la calle,
Se bebe y se fuma,
Quiere un tipo que la presuma,
Su booty heavy weight,
El jacuzzi con espuma,
Chingando escuchando a Peso Pluma

Esa falda,
Chiquitita,
Ay que bonita te queda,
Yo la veía to’ los días,
Ahora es cuando se pueda,
Y de la uni yo la saco hasta donde se hospeda,
Y las demás que sigan envidiando,
Por eso no prosperan

Dale espacio a las demás,
Pa’ que brillen bebé,
Tu no lo haces a mal,
Solo haces tu deber,
Dime donde estas que yo te quiero ver,
Es intocable si pasa se tienen que mover,
Esta enfocada en la de ella pero a veces se distrae,
Se pone traje o falda pa’ que se lo encaje,
No le hablen de embarazo ni de pruebas de dopaje,
Se puso creativa con la hierba que le traje,
Y ella esta haciendo un bachillerato,
Yo llevo rato comiéndomela pero no dejo rastro,
Llegue con Yannc, con Chalko en una Raptor,
Trai mas sustancias que den abasto,
El alcohol hizo que a la amiga quiera besar,
Sin querer la toque y se la subió sin pensar

Esa falda,
Chiquitita,
Ay que bonita te queda,
Yo la veía to’ los días,
Ahora es cuando se pueda,
Y de la uni yo la saco hasta donde se hospeda,
Y las demás que sigan envidiando,
Por eso no prosperan

Lyrics:
It always ends the same
when it was me and you
but every time I meet somebody new 
its like de ja vu

I swear they sound the same 
Its like they know my skin
every word they say sounds just like him 
and it goes like this

we’ll get in ur car and 
you’ll lean to kiss me 
we’ll talk for hours
and lie on the back seat 

Uh huh uh huh

Then one random night  
when everything changes  
You wont reply 
and we’ll go back to strangers 

Uh huh uh huh

it’s something that I hate 
how everyones disposable 
now every time I date somebody new 
I feel vulnerable 

that it’ll never change 
& it will just stay like this 
never ending dating breaking up
and it goes like this 

we’ll get in ur car and 
you’ll lean to kiss me 
we’ll talk for hours
and lie on the back seat 

Uh huh uh huh

Then one random night  
when everything changes  
You wont reply 
and we’ll go back to strangers 

Uh huh uh huh

It always ends the same
when it was me and u 
but every time I meet somebody new 
its like de ja vu

when we spoke for months 
did u ever mean it? 
how can they say that this is love?
when it goes like this

we’ll get in ur car and 
you’ll lean to kiss me 
we’ll talk for hours
and lie on the back seat 

Uh huh uh huh

Then one random night  
when everything changes  
You wont reply 
and we’ll go back to strangers 

Uh huh uh huh

Official “yes, and?” lyrics: 
in case you haven’t noticed
well, everybody’s tired 
and healing from somebody 
or something we don’t see just right

boy come on put your lipstick on
(no one can tell you nothing)
come on and walk this way through the fire 
(don’t care what’s on their mind) 
and if you find yourself in a dark situation just 
turn on your light and be like 

“yes, and?”
say that shit with your chest….. and
be your own fuckin best….. friend
say that shit with your chest….. 
keep moving like “what’s next?”
“yes, and?”

now i’m so done with caring 
what you think, no i won’t hide
underneath your own projections
or change my most authentic life

boy come on put your lipstick on 
(no one can tell you nothing)
come on and walk this way through the fire 
(don’t care what’s on their mind) 
and if you find yourself in a dark situation just 
turn on your light and be like 

“yes, and?”
say that shit with your chest….. and
be your own fuckin best….. friend
say that shit with your chest….. 
keep moving like “what’s next?”
“yes, and?”

my tongue is sacred, i speak upon what i like
protected, sexy, discerning with my time
your energy is yours and mine is mine
what’s mine is mine

my face is sitting i don’t need no disguise
don’t comment on my body, do not reply 
your business is yours and mine is mine
why do you care so much whose ! i ride
why?

“yes, and?”
say that shit with your chest….. and
be your own fuckin best…..friend
say that shit with your chest….. 
keep moving like “what’s next?”
“yes, and?”

Lyrics

It can’t be said I’m an early bird
It’s ten o’clock before I say a word
Baby, I can never tell
How do you sleep so well
You keep telling me to live right
To go to bed before daylight
But then you wake up for the sunrise
You know you don’t gotta pretend
Baby, now and then

Don’t you just wanna wake up
Dark as a lake
Smelling like a bonfire
Lost in a haze
If you’re drunk on life, babe
I think it’s great
But while in this world

I think I’ll take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You’re too sweet for me
You’re too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You’re too sweet for me
You’re too sweet for me

I aim low
I aim true and the ground is where I go
I work late where I’m free from the phone
And the job gets done
But you worry some, I know
But who wants to live forever babe
You treat your mouth as if it’s heaven’s gate
The rest of you like you’re the TSA
I wish that I could go along
Babe, don’t get me wrong

You know you’re bright as the morning
As soft as the rain
Pretty as a vine
As sweet as a grape
If you can sit in a barrel
Maybe I’ll wait
Until that day 

I’d rather take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You’re too sweet for me
You’re too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You’re too sweet for me
You’re too sweet for me

I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You’re too sweet for me
You’re too sweet for me

Lyrics:
I took the page out of your favorite book 
You sold me lies just by the way you look
Taught me a language that I’ll never speak 
Baby, that ain't for me 
That, that ain't for me
 
I dug my grave watching the way you move 
You took me higher than I ever flew
Too many times gave you a second chance
Baby I’m just a man 
I’m, I’m just a man 
 
No more thinking about you late night 
No more running around with your friends now
Done picking the pieces of my soul up off the floor
 
I said I would die for you baby 
But I can’t take this pain no mo 
I thought I was willing 
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door 
 
I don't want to lose you baby 
But I can’t play this game no mo
I thought it would kill me 
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door  

You never thought this day would ever come 
When I looked you in the eyes and pulled the rug 
You tried to take away my sanity
Baby, that ain't for me 
That, that ain't for me 

Oh no more thinking about you late night 
No more running around with your friends now
Done picking the pieces of my soul from off the floor

I said I would die for you baby 
But I can’t take this pain no mo 
I thought I was willing 
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door 

I don't want to lose you baby 
But I can’t play this game no mo
I thought it would kill me 
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door  

When I showed you the door  (X2)
But tonight I saved my life 

I said I would die for you baby 
But I can’t take this pain no mo 
I thought I was willing 
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door 

I don't want to lose you baby 
But I can’t take this game no mo 
I thought it would kill me 
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door",80483924,514671,0,9782
44,Zach Bryan,Zach Bryan - I Remember Everything (feat. Kacey Musgraves),2023-08-25T04:00:31Z,"Rot gut whiskey’s gonna ease my mind
Beach town rests on the “drying” line
Do I remind you of your daddy in his 88 Ford?
Labrador hanging out the passenger door
The sand from your hair is blowing in my eyes
Blame it on the beach grown men don’t cry

Do you remember that beatdown basement couch
I’d sing you my love songs and you’d tell me about
How your momma ran off and pawned her ring
I remember, I remember everything

A cold shoulder a closing time 
you were begging me to stay till the sun rose
Strange words come on out of a grown man’s mouth when his minds broke
Pictures and passing time you only smile like that when you’re drinking
I wish I didn’t but I do, remember every moment on the nights with you

You’re drinking everything to ease your mind
When in the hell are you gonna ease mine
You’re like concrete feet in the summer heat
It burns like hell when two souls meet 
And you’ll never be the man you always swore
But I’ll remember your singing in that ’88 Ford

A cold shoulder a closing time 
you were begging me to stay till the sun rose
Strange words come on out of a grown man’s mouth when his minds broke
Pictures and passing time you only smile like that when you’re drinking
I wish I didn’t but I do, remember every moment on the nights with you

Lyrics:
Moon, a hole of light 
Through the big top tent up high 
Here before and after me 
Shining down on me 
Moon, tell me if I could 
Send up my heart to you 
So when I die, which I must do 
Could it shine down here with you 
 
’Cause my love is mine all mine 
I love, my my mine 
Nothing in the world belongs to me 
But my love, mine all mine all mine 
 
My baby here on earth 
Showed me what my heart was worth 
So when it comes to be my turn 
Could you shine it down here for her 
 
’Cause my love is mine all mine 
I love, my my mine 
Nothing in the world belongs to me 
But my love, mine all mine 
Nothing in the world is mine for free 
But my love, mine all mine all mine

Lyrics:
Traffic dies while we are racing home
Melted lights cover the open road
I hope we make it, cause I've been chasing another odyssey
Oh
I can't wait to see your face crash when we’re switching lanes
My love’s beyond the pain but if i miss the brake, we’re dancing in the flames
Its indescribable
Ooooooh
The world can’t heal they say on the radio
So grab the wheel, want you to be in control
We’re dodgin’ headlights
And you say hold tight
Another odyssey, ohhhh
I can't wait to see your face crash when we’re switching lanes
My love’s beyond the pain but if i miss the brake we’re dancing in the flames
Its indescribable
Everything’s faded
We barely made it
The fire’s raging
But you're still beautiful
And it’s amazing
Cause i can taste it
Our final odyssey
Oooooooh
I can't wait to see your face crash when we’re switching lanes
My love’s beyond the pain but if i miss the brake we’re dancing in the flames
So just have faith
We’ll never be the same
It’s indescribable
indescribable

Lyrics:
Traffic dies while we are racing home
Melted lights cover the open road
I hope we make it, cause I've been chasing another odyssey
Oh
I can't wait to see your face crash when we’re switching lanes
My love’s beyond the pain but if i miss the brake, we’re dancing in the flames
Its indescribable
Ooooooh
The world can’t heal they say on the radio
So grab the wheel, want you to be in control
We’re dodgin’ headlights
And you say hold tight
Another odyssey, ohhhh
I can't wait to see your face crash when we’re switching lanes
My love’s beyond the pain but if i miss the brake we’re dancing in the flames
Its indescribable
Everything’s faded
We barely made it
The fire’s raging
But you're still beautiful
And it’s amazing
Cause i can taste it
Our final odyssey
Oooooooh
I can't wait to see your face crash when we’re switching lanes
My love’s beyond the pain but if i miss the brake we’re dancing in the flames
So just have faith
We’ll never be the same
It’s indescribable
indescribable
indescribable

Lyrics:
We had a plan 
Move out of this town baby 
West to the sand We had a
It’s all we talked about lately 
I’d pack the car, bring your guitar and Jane for smoking 
First thing at dawn you’d cue the songs and we’d get going

But you weren’t home 
Waited on the porch for ya 
Sat there alone
All throughout the morn till I
Got a hunch, down in my gut 
And snuck around the back 
Empty cans and I’ll be damned 
Your shit was never packed 

Did your boots stop workin? 
Did your truck break down?
Did you burn through the money? 
Did your ex find out? 
Where there’s a will then there’s a way and I’m damn sure you lost it 
Didn’t even say goodbye
Just wish I knew what caused it 

Was the whiskey flowing? 
Were you in a fight?
Did the nerves come get ya? 
What’s your alibi?
I made my way back to LA, and that’s where you’ll be forgotten 
In 40 years you’ll still be here, drunk, washed up in Austin 

A hell of bluff
You had me believin’
How many months
Did you plan on leaving
What happened, bad habits 
Did you go back,
Go batshit 
I loved you, how tragic

Did your boots stop workin? 
Did your truck break down?
Did you burn through the money? 
Did your ex find out? 
Where there’s a will then there’s a way and I’m damn sure you lost it 
Didn’t even say goodbye
Just wish I knew what caused it 

Was the whiskey flowing? 
Were you in a fight?
Did the nerves come get ya? 
What’s your alibi?
I made my way back to LA, and that’s where you’ll be forgotten 
In 40 years you’ll still be here, drunk, washed up in Austin

Lyrics:
I’d never met you but I wanted
To invite you to the party
Then you walked in
With those green eyes never stolen by nobody

And they flicker to the future
For a moment I could picture
Then you touch me
And I come back and we’re talking on the staircase

Bout your big dreams, on the big screen
Out of Georgia now you’re lonely in this city
Lying with me
And you’re scared it’s moving quickly

Now you’re crying
You’re in pieces
Cause the only love you’ve ever known is Jesus
I can feel it
And I hate that I’m the reason that you’re
You’re in your head right now
While your whole world is spinning out

So slow it down
Take a moment now
We’re too young to drown
Deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubts
Let me pull you out
Let me hold you now
let me help you slow it down

Ain’t it funny, how it changes
How a future rearranges
I get nervous, oh I’m anxious
Maybe loving you is dangerous
I could lose you like the others
Only girl that’s never left me is my mother
Oh I love her
And I know you probably hate it

But I’m in my head my head right now

So slow it down
Take a moment now
We’re too young to drown
Deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubts
Let me pull you out
Let me hold you now
let me…

Slow it
Slow it down
When you’re on the ground
And you’re crying
I’m just trying
To slow it down
When you’re spinning round
In your head

I’ll help you slow it down

Not trynna be romantic
I’ll hit it from the back
Just so you don’t get attached 

You bite my lip
Just for the taste
You’re on your knees
I’m on the case

You take the heat
And with such grace
You say we’re done but here u stay

Said you’re scared I’ll let you down
Stick around and you’ll find out
Don’t you wanna make me proud
Cause I’m so proud
Baby I’m so proud of you

I like the way you kiss me
I can tell you miss me
I can tell it hits, hits, hits, hits

I can tell it hits, hits, hits, hits

Not trynna be romantic
I’ll hit it from the back
Just so you don’t get attached 

Do I stress you out? 
Can I help you out ?
Does it turn you on
When I turn you round?
Can we make a scene
Can we make it loud
Cause I’m so proud
Yeh I’m so proud of you

LYRICS:
Sun is going down, time is running out
No one else around but me
Steady losing light
Steady losing my mind
Moving shadows and grinding teeth

Without you, there ain't no place for me to hide
Without you, there's no way I can sleep tonight
What I’d do for a little bit of peace and quiet
Without you I keep

Slippin into bad dreams
Where there’s no you and I
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free
From all of these bad dreams
Waiting on the other side
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free from all of these, all of these 
(ooh) Bad dreams
(ooh) All of these, baby, please

Come around
Help me settle down
Hellish habits can cloud my head
What you waiting for
Something physical
I can’t do this by myself

Without you, there ain't no place for me to hide
Without you, there's no way I can sleep tonight
What I’d do for a little bit of peace and quiet
Without you I keep

Slippin into bad dreams
Where there’s no you and I
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free
From all of these (all of these) bad dreams
Waiting on the other side
No sound when I cry
I love you and I need you to set me free (set me free) from all of these, all of these
(ooh) Bad dreams, baby, please
(ooh) All of these (baby, please) all of these

LYRICS

I could be the one or your new addiction
It’s all in my head but I want non-fiction
I don’t want the world but I’ll take this city who can blame a girl call me hot not pretty 

Baby don’t you like this beat
I made so you’d sleep with me
It’s like a hundred ninety-nine degrees 
When you’re doing it with me, doing it with me

H-O-T-T-O-G-O
Snap n’ clap n’ and touch your toes 
Raise your hands now body roll 
Dance it out you’re hot to go
H-O-T-T-O-G-O 
Snap n’ clap n’ touch your toes 
Raise your hands now body roll 
H-O-T-T-O-G-O

H-O-T-T-O-G-O
YOU CAN TAKE ME HOT TO GO 
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
YOU CAN TAKE ME HOT TO GO 

Well I woke up alone Staring at my ceiling
I try not to care but it hurts my feelings
You don’t have to stare come here get with it
No one’s touched me there in a damn hot minute

And baby don’t you like this beat
I made so you’d sleep with me
It’s like a hundred ninety-nine degrees 
When you’re doing it with me, doing it with me

H-O-T-T-O-G-O
Snap n’ clap n’ and touch your toes 
Raise your hands now body roll 
Dance it out you’re hot to go
H-O-T-T-O-G-O 
Snap n’ clap n’ touch your toes 
Raise your hands now body roll 
H-O-T-T-O-G-O

H-O-T-T-O-G-O
YOU CAN TAKE ME HOT TO GO 
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
YOU CAN TAKE ME HOT TO GO 

What’s it take to get your number 
What’s it take to bring you home 
Hurry up it’s time for supper
Order up I’m hot to go

What’s it take to get your number 
Hurry up it’s gettin’ cold 
Hurry up it’s time for supper
Order up I’m hot to go

H-O-T-T-O-G-OO
YOU CAN TAKE ME HOT TO GO 
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
YOU CAN TAKE ME HOT TO GO 

(Hot to go)
H-O-T-T-O-G-OO
YOU CAN TAKE ME HOT TO GO 
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
YOU CAN TAKE ME HOT TO GO 

Whew it’s hot in here
Is anyone else hot?
You comin’ home with me? 
It’s hot. I’ll call the cab.

Lyrics:
I ain’t never rep a set baby
I ain’t do no wrong
I could clean up good for you
Oh I know right from wrong
Cause I wanna make it (so badly)
I’m a Million Dollar Baby (don’t at me)
Hell no

You rep my city for so damn long
But you still don’t notice me
My sound next
VA next
I’m at they neck
I’m running up a check
She a bad lil mama she a diva
No matter what happens he cannot come between us again
I know we’re better than friends (better than friends)
I took her to Queen’s Gambit, showed around my friends
Tried to pick some energy up it don’t better
I know you haven’t moved on, if you tried
I don’t believe it baby, I know you lied
All night long
What you mean I changed
Haven't stayed the same
I’ve been losing my mind
I said the city is mine

I ain’t never rep a set baby
Ain’t do no wrong
I could clean up, do it for you
Oh I know right from wrong
Cause I wanna make it (so badly)
I’m a Million Dollar Baby (don’t at me)
I ain’t never rep a set baby
Ain’t do no wrong
I could clean up, good for you
Oh I know right from wrong
Cause I wanna make it (so badly)
I’m a Million Dollar Baby (don’t at me)

Hell no
Hell no
Hell no

END OF BEGINNING LYRICS:
Just one more tear to cry 
One teardrop from my eye 
You better save it for 
The middle of the night 
When things aren’t black and white 
Enter, Troubadour:
“Remember 24?”
 
And when I’m back in Chicago, I feel it 
Another version of me, I was in it
I wave goodbye to the end of beginning 
 
This song has started now 
And you're just finding out 
Now isn’t that a laugh? 
A major sacrifice but clueless at the time 
Enter, Caroline:
“Just trust me you’ll be fine”
 
And when I’m back in Chicago I feel it 
Another version of me, I was in it
I wave goodbye to the end of beginning 
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
 
You take the man out of the city, not the city out the man
You take the man out of the city, not the city out the man
You take the man out of the city, not the city out the man
You take the man out of the 
 
And when I’m back in Chicago, I feel it 
Another version of me, I was in it
I wave goodbye to the end of beginning 
Goodbye
Goodbye

Hey!

Take my heart don’t break it
Love me to my bones
All this time I wasted
You were right there all along
You and I stargazing
Intertwining souls
We were never strangers
You were right there all along

I lose my mind
When I’m around you how I come alive
When I’m without you
I can’t help but feel so lost
I wanna give you all I’ve got

Ooh
They say you know it when you know it
And I know
Ooh
Promise that you’ll hold me close don’t let me go

🎤 Lyrics: Teddy Swims - Lose Control 

Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don't know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closing in
And the devil's knocking at my door, whoa

Outta my mind, how many times
Did I tell you I'm no good at being alone?
Yeah it's taking a toll on me, trying my best to keep
From tearing the skin off my bones, don't you know

I lose control
When you're not next to me
I'm falling apart right in front of you
Can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me
Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby
You make a mess of me

Problematic, problem is
I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habit's hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah I know, I could do it on my own, but I want
That real full moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic, problem is
When I'm with you I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darling please, oh

I lose control
When you're not next to me
I'm falling apart right in front of you
Can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not next to me
Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby
You make a mess of me, yeah

I lose control
When you're not here with me
I'm falling apart right in front of you
Can't you see?
I lose control
When you're not here with me
Yeah, you're breaking my heart, baby
You make a mess of me

Forty hours got me goin’ out my mind
Dallas dropped another game in overtime
Caught a ticket speedin’ down the, sixty five
You know where, I’m goin’
 
Guess I went and really messed it up again
Now my baby’s gonner than a Tulsa wind
Judgin’ by the stone sober, state I’m in
Need to crack one
Wide open
 
Somebody pour me a drink
Somebody bum me a smoke
I’m bout to get on a buzz
I’m bout to get on a roll
Yeah I’ve been breakin’ my back
Just keepin’ up with the Jones’es
Y’all know what I mean
Y’all know how it goes
When it’s up on a Friday, and I’m paid
Slide one over my way
I can’t even think when
I can hear one calling my name
Somebody pour me a drink
Pour me a drink
 
Bourbon brown eyes tryna, get me drunk
Can’t stop until the bottle and the, job is done
Yeah I think I mighta found my, future love
 
Buddy you should probably buy her one
 
Somebody pour me a drink
Somebody bum me a smoke
I’m bout to get on a buzz
I’m bout to get on a roll
Yeah I’ve been breakin’ my back
Just keepin’ up with the Jones’es
Y’all know what I mean
Y’all know how it goes
When it’s up on a Friday, and I’m paid
Slide one over my way

As a spellbinding storyteller, sharp songwriter, powerhouse performer and history-making, platinum-certified phenomenon, Bailey Zimmerman has personified the American dream from the get-go. And now, with the release of his full-length debut LP, Religiously. The Album. (Warner Music Nashville/Elektra), this young artist with the rasp of a seasoned rocker and the heart of a sensitive songwriter surges to the forefront of 21st century country music and arrives at the cusp of superstardom. The album finds Zimmerman making a statement, amplifying tried-and-true country stories with unapologetic arena rock ambition and electrifying power from every angle. Alongside current single and title track “Religiously,” the album features his Multi-Platinum, debut #1 single, “Fall In Love,” alongside his most recent Multi-Platinum hit, “Rock And A Hard Place,” which spent a whopping six consecutive weeks at the top of Billboard’s Country Airplay Chart in addition to being his first Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 hit to date. Both tracks were also included on his record-shattering debut EP, Leave The Light On, which made history upon release as the biggest streaming country debut of all time and the most-streamed all-genre debut of the year. Quickly closing in on 2 billion streams and counting, Zimmerman closed out 2022 as the year’s only country artist to receive two Platinum certifications from the RIAA and was named Billboard’s #2 Top New Country Artist and #4 Top New Artist Overall. The 2023 ACM Awards New Male Artist of the Year nominee and CMT Music Awards multi-nominee has ignited television audiences with show-stopping performances on Good Morning America, Dick Clark’s New Year’s Rockin’ Eve, Jimmy Kimmel LIVE! and the 58th Academy of Country Music Awards, and incited critical applause from Forbes, Rolling Stone, The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Billboard and many more. He’s out on the road now with Morgan Wallen as part of his monumental 2023 One Night At A Time Tour, and already selling out football stadiums coast-to-coast including SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, Wrigley Field in Chicago and Truist Park in Atlanta.

Lyrics: 
See u so excited 
U got him locked down 
Ur moving like I did 
Before I found out 
He ain’t just a pretty faced talker 
Good with his money 
Close to his mother 
Ur seeing one-sided 
U got him right now 

And she be like he’s so perfect 
I be like oh, what version ?
Ain’t nobody got me this nervous
Oh baby I been there 
And right in that same position 
So baby don’t get this twisted 
No, nothing could make me miss it
Take him he’s yours 

It’s ok I’m ok
Had him in the 1st place 
It’s ok I’m ok 
It’s ok I’m ok 
I don’t rlly gotta say it’s ok 
You can have him anyway 
Anyway 
You can have him anyway 
Anyway

Was such a romantic 
U got me like fuck that 
Some months and some long flights 
Now I can’t go near that  

And she be like he’s so perfect 
I be like oh, what version ?
Ain’t nobody got me this nervous
Oh baby I been there

Lyrics

la-da-da-da, da-da-da 
la-da-da-da-da 
la-da-da-da, da-da-da

if i told you how much i think about her
you'd think i was in love
and if you knew how much i looked at her pictures 
you would think we're best friends

'cause i know her star sign, i know her blood type
i've seen every movie she's been in, and, oh god, she's beautiful and i know you loved her, and i know i'm butthurt
but i can't help it, no i can't help it

i'm so obsessed with your ex (uh-huh)
i know she's been asleep on my side of your bed, and i can feel it
i'm starin' at her like i wanna get hurt
and i remember every detail you have evеr told me, so be careful, 
baby i'm so obsеssed with your ex (ah)
yeah, i'm so obsessed with your ex (ah)

la-da-da-da, da-da-da
she's got those lips, she's got those hips the life of every fuckin' party
she's talented, she's good with kids
she even speaks kindly about me (ah-ah)

and i know you love me, and i know it's crazy
but every time you call my name, i think you mistake me for her 
you both have moved on, you don't even talk
but i can't help it, i got issues, i can't help it, baby

i'm so obsessed with your ex
i know she's been asleep on my side of your bed, and i can feel it
i'm starin' at her like i wanna get hurt
and i remember every detail you have ever told me, 
so be careful, baby 
i'm so obsessed with your ex (ah)
yeah, i'm so obsessed with your ex (ah)

is she friends with your friends? is she good in bed?
do you think about her? no i'm fine, it doesn't matter, tell me
 is she easy-going? never controlling?
well-traveled? well-read? oh god, she makes me so upset

i'm so obsessed with your ex (ah)
she's been asleep on my side of your bed (ah, woah)
i'm so obsessed with your ex (god, she makes me so upset) 
i'm so obsessed with your, with your ex

Lyrics:
I was in a sheer dress
The day that we met 
We were both in a rush 
We talked for a sec 
Your friend hit me up 
So we could connect
And what are the odds 
You send me a text 
And now the next 
Thing I know I’m like 
Manifest
That you’re oversized 
I digress 
Got me scrollin’ like 
Out of breath 
Got me going like 
Oooo ahhhhh 
 
Who’s the cute boy with the white jacket and the thick accent like 
(Ahhhhh) 
Maybe it’s all in my head 
 
But I bet we’d have really good bed chem 
How you pick me up pull ‘em down turn me round oh it just makes sense 
How you talk so sweet when you’re doing bad things 
That’s bed chem 
How you’re looking at me yea I know what that means and 
I’m obsessed
Are you free next week? 
I’d bet we’d have really good 
 
Come right on me 
I mean camaraderie    
Said you’re not in my time zone but you wanna be 
Where art thou? Why not uponeth me? 
See it my mind let’s fulfill the prophecy 
 
Who’s the cute guy with wide blue eyes and the big bad mmm like 
I know I sound a bit redundant 
 
But I bet we’d have really good bed chem 
How you pick me up pull ‘em down turn me round oh it just makes sense 
How you talk so sweet when you’re doing bad things 
That’s bed chem 
How you’re looking at me yeah I know what that means and 
I’m obsessed
Are you free next week? 
I’d bet we’d have really good 
Bed chem 
 
And I bet we’d both arrive at the same time 
And I bet the thermostats set at six nine 
And I bet it’s even better than in my head 


How you pick me up pull ‘em down turn me round oh it just makes sense 
How you talk so sweet when you’re doing bad things 
That’s bed chem 
How you’re looking at me yeah I know what that means and 
I’m obsessed
Are you free next week? 
I’d bet we’d have really good

Lyrics:
I am not okay
I’m barely getting by
Losing track of days
And losing sleep at night

I am not okay
I’m hanging on the rails
So if I say I’m fine
Just know I’ve learned to hide it well

I know I can’t be the only one
Who’s holding on for dear life
But God knows, I know
When it’s all said and done
I’m not okay
But it’s all gonna be alright
It’s not okay
But we’re all gonna be alright

I woke up today
I almost stayed in bed
Had the devil on my back
And voices in my head

Some days it ain’t all bad
Some days it all gets worse
Some days I swear I’m better off
Layin’ in that dirt

I know I can’t be the only one
Who’s holding on for dear life
But God knows, I know
When it’s all said and done
I’m not okay
But it’s all gonna be alright
It’s not okay
But we’re all gonna be alright
Gonna be all right
Gonna be all right

I know one day
We’ll see the other side
The pain’ll wash away
In a holy water tide
And we all gonna be alright

I know I can’t be the only one
Who’s holding on for dear life
But God knows, I know
When it’s all said and done
I’m not okay
But it’s all gonna be alright
It’s not okay
But we’re all gonna be alright
I’m not okay
But it’s all gonna be alright

Lyrics:
Girl, let's go put some miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine running
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
We could break it in
If you know what I mean
 
New truck, big lift, old roads
We've been tearing up since way back when
But these wheels are innocent
New hitch, new seats, no history
And you just can't fake that
 
So, let's change that, girl, let's go put some miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine running
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
We could break it in
If you know what I mean
 
Put some miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine running
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
We could break it in
If you know what I mean
Put some miles on it
We could break it in
If you know what I mean
 
All night, no brakes, all tail, no gate
Ain't gotta try too hard
My baby's push to start
All torque, full speed, off road
On me zero to a hundred fast
 
My foot ain't touch the gas
I said, hey baby, slow it down
Let's make it last
You said, where's the fun in that
Yeah, let's go
 
Put some miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine running
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
We could break it in
If you know what I mean
 
Put some miles on it
We could break it in
If you know what I mean
 
Put some miles on it
We could break it in
If you know what I mean
 
Mile after mile after mile after mile
Turn up the night like that radio dial
Shoulder to shoulder where nobody knows
Know where we're going, we ain't going home
 
We're putting miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine running
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California king
We could break it in
If you know what I mean
 
Put some miles on it
Back of the Chevy with the engine running
Just you and me in a truck bed wide like a California King
We could break it in
If you know what I mean
Put some miles on it
 
We could break it in
If you know what I mean
Put some miles on it
 
We could break it in
If you know what I mean
Put some miles on it

Lyrics: 

Opened up my journal to a page
Everything that hurts me’s still the same
Feels like there’s nothing new for me to say
Why why why
Why why why
Sweating through the sheets shakin’ in bed
Visions of her naked in my head
But I went off and chose myself instead
Why why why
Ease my mind
I don't know why, I
I don’t know, I dont know why
Why why why
I stepped off the stage with nothing left
All the lights were fuckin’ with my head
But here I am, singing songs again
Why why why
Ease my mind
I don’t know why, I
I don’t know, I don’t know why
Why why why
Why why why
Feels like everything goes round and round and round and round and round it goes
Feels like everything goes round and round and round and round and round it
Thought I was about to be a father
Shook me to the core, I’m still a kid
Sometimes I still cry out for my mother
Why why why
Why why why
I don’t know why, I
I don’t know, I don’t know why
Why why why
Why why why
Feels like everything goes round and round and round and round and round it goes
Feels like everything goes round and round and round and round and round it goes

(Lyrics)
[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across thе border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it mеans to be livin'
[Verse 3]
See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruising and entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

[Chorus]
Said I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 5]
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I, I, had a feeling that I belonged
I, I, had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

My boy’s a winner
He loves the game
My lips reflect off his cross-gold chain
I like the way
He’s telling me
My ass looks good in these ripped blue jeans
My cheeks are red like cherries in the spring
Body’s a work of art you’d die to see
 
Untouched

Young lust
Let’s
 
When we drive in your car
I’m your baby (so sweet)
Losing all my innocence in the backseat
Say you love say you love
Say you love me (love me)
Losing all my innocence in the backseat
 
When we drive in your car
I’m your baby (so sweet)
Losing all my innocence in the backseat
Say you love say you love
Say you love me (love me)
Losing all my innocence in the backseat
 
Break all the rules till we get caught
Fog up the windows in the parking lot
Summer love
Sexy
Sittin’ on his lap sippin’ diet pepsi
 
I write my name with lipstick on your chest
I leave a mark so you know I’m the best
 
Untouched

LYRICS

We’ve been through low
Been through sunshine, been through snow
All the colours of the weather
We’ve been through high
Every corner of the sky
And still we’re holding on together

You got all my love
Whether it rains or pours, I’m all yours
You’ve got all my love
Whether it rains, it remains
You’ve got all my love

(And) til I die
Let me hold you if you cry
Be my one two three forever

Cause you got all my love
Whether it rains or pours
I’m all yours
You’ve got all my love
Whether it rains, it remains
You’ve got all my love

La La La La La La Lay
Whether it rains or pours, I’m all yours
La La La La La La Lay
That’s all, all I can say

You got all my love
Oh for now and always
Til the end of my days
You got all my love
You’ve got all my love

►Lyrics:

(Verse 1)
Last callers, last chancers
9 to 5ers, truckers, dancers
Couple Chuck’s, Ern’s, and Chandler’s
With a whole lotta prayers unanswered
Whiskey by noon, and beer before that
Southbound train on a hellbound track
Might just put two middle fingers up and throw one back for all the
People who ain’t ever felt at home
Just spinnin’ on a rock and gettin’ stoned

(Chorus)
Yeah this one’s for the Losers
The outcasts and the sinners
The ain’t never been no winners
Let’s hear it for the Losers
Ain’t got nowhere to fit in
There’s a place you can always get in
Oh
You might be lonely but you’re never alone
You’re right here where you’re supposed to be
Right here with all the Losers
The one’s like you
And the one’s like me

(Verse 2) (Jelly Roll)
My therapist is a good bartender
Heart breakers and two month benders
Bad times that we can’t forget and
Good times that we won’t remember
Raise ‘em up when we hear a sad song
Love the cry of a steel guitar
No way to change the way we are

(Chorus) (Jelly Roll)
This one’s for the Losers
The outcasts and the sinners
The ain’t never been no winners
Let’s hear it for the Losers
Ain’t got nowhere to fit in
There’s a place you can always get in
Oh, oh
You might be lonely but you’re never alone
You’re right here where you’re supposed to be
Right here with all the Losers
The one’s like you
And the one’s like me

(Bridge) (Post)
If you’re livin’ like you got nothin’ to lose

(Bridge) (Jelly Roll)
There’s a spot for you beside me on this stool

(Chorus) (Post & Jelly Roll)
Come kick it with the Losers
The outcasts and the sinners
The ain’t never been no winners
Let’s hear it for the Losers
Ain’t got nowhere to fit in
There’s a place you can always get in
Oh, oh
You might be lonely but you’re never alone
You’re right here where you’re supposed to be
Right here with all the Losers
The one’s like you
And the one’s like me

Lyrics:

I, I let you drive around my mind 
I can't count the times you made me feel like I’m nothin'
Played me like a fool 
Like a fool

Sayin' drink another whiskey 
Pop another pill 
Money makes you happy 
Heaven isn’t real 
You won’t find nobody to love 
Because your heart’s too broke 
Now I know 

You ain’t nothin but a liar 
Yeah I walked right out the fire 
Yeah you tried to keep me down 
Tried to put me underground 
But I’m only goin' higher 

I can hear you in my head 
In my bed when i’m dreamin' 
You try to be my friend but you’re blowin’ smoke 
Oh and now I ain’t scared of tellin’ you where you can go
'Cause I know 

You’re nothin’ but a lie
You burned me one too many times 
Like a devil in disguise hidin’ your true colors
Just leave me alone
Keep leadin’ me on

Sayin' drink another whiskey 
Pop another pill 
Money makes you happy 
Heaven isn’t real 
You won’t find nobody to love 
Because your heart’s too broke 
Now I know 

You ain’t nothin’ but a liar 
Yeah I walked right out the fire 
Yeah you tried to keep me down 
Tried to put me underground 
But I’m only goin' higher 

I can hear you in my head 
In my bed when I’m dreamin' 
You try to be my friend but you’re blowin’ smoke 
Oh and now I ain’t scared of tellin’ you where you can go
'Cause I know 
You’re nothin’ but a liar

If I was doing what you do
You would say I poisoned you

You’re nothin’ but a liar 
Yeah I walked right out the fire 
Yeah you tried to keep me down 
Tried to put me underground 
But I’m only goin' higher 

I can hear you in my head 
In my bed when I’m dreamin' 
You try to be my friend but you’re blowin’ smoke 
Oh and now I ain’t scared of tellin’ you where you can go
'Cause I know 
You’re nothin’ but a liar

Lyrics: 
Rumors goin’ all over town
Can’t keep my name out they mouth these days, yeah they say
I live too fast to settle down
Truth is I just ain’t about these games they all play
 
Wanna find somethin’ stronger than the whiskey
And oh I’ve tried, but every time I feel her kiss me
I keep comin' up empty yeah
 
I just wanna love somebody
Who won't leave a hole in my heart
I just wanna love somebody
That don’t want me fallin’ apart
And I’ll be lucky if I ever find
A somethin' more than just a crazy night
I just wanna love somebody
 
Who ain't hypnotized
By dollar signs and blindin' lights, like they tend to be, yeah
I need someone that I'd be proud
To take on back to my hometown
Honest eyes that just ain’t gonna lead to
 
Lonely nights even when she’s up against me
I don’t know why it feels like there’s nobody with me
And I’m still empty, yeah
 
I just wanna love somebody
Who won't leave a hole in my heart
I just wanna love somebody
That don’t want me fallin’ apart
And I’ll be lucky if I ever find
A somethin' more than just a crazy night
I just wanna love somebody
 
I just wanna love somebody
(Wooah)
 
I just wanna love somebody
Who won't leave a hole in my heart
I just wanna love somebody
That don’t want me fallin’ apart
And I’ll be lucky if I ever find
A somethin' more than just a crazy night
I just wanna love somebody

(Lyrics):
[Verse 1]
It's fine, it's cool
You can say that we are nothing, but you know the truth
And guess I'm the fool
With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna call it off
But you don't wanna call it love
You only wanna be the one that I call baby

[Chorus]
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

[Verse 2]
I'm cliché, who cares?
It's a sexually explicit kind of love affair
And I cry, it's not fair
I just need a little lovin', I just need a little air

[Pre-Chorus]
Think I'm gonna call it off
Even if you call it love
I just wanna love someone who calls me baby

[Chorus]
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)

[Bridge]
When you wake up next to him in the middle of the night
With your head in your hands, you're nothing more than his wife
And when you think about me, all of those years ago
You're standing face to face with ""I told you so""
You know I hate to say it, I told you so
You know I hate to say, but I told you so

[Chorus]
You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling (Well, I told you so)
You can say it's just the way you are
Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
Good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
Well, good luck, babe (Well, good luck)
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling

Mami, es que yo estoy trending 
Vamono al piegari tocandote en la lambo o en el ferrari
